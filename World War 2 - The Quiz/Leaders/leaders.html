    <h2>Leaders</h2>
    <h3>
      This page aims to give you some very basic details about each of the
      leaders of the main Allied and Axis nations. The nations in question are
      only those active at the end of the war, and so will not include France.
      However, it is important to recognise the important role the faction of
      Free France played in the allied victory, particularly in the liberation
      of Axis-controlled African nations.

      Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was a British statesman who served
      as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 (during the
      second world war). Churchill was born on 30 November 1874 at his family's
      ancestral home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England. His father, Lord
      Randolph Churchill, served as an MP for Woodstock; his mother, Jennie
      Spencer Churchill, was a daughter of Leonard Jerome, a wealthy American
      businessman.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Churchill was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924, before
      joining the Conservatives the following year. He is widely considered to
      be one of the most prominent figures of the 20th century, and one of the
      most important leaders in the history of Great Britain - as he led the
      country to victory in the Second World War.

      Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was an American politician and attorney
      who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 until his
      death in 1945. Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New
      York, to businessman James Roosevelt and his second wife, Sara Ann Delano.
      They were sixth cousins and both came from wealthy New York families.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      FDR famously led the US into Second World War in 1941, following the
      Japanese Empire's attack on the Hawaii naval base, Pearl Harbor. Prior to
      this, the US did not want to get involved in the conflict in Europe as
      public support was low. However, they did provide the UK with supplies.

      Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin was a Georgian revolutionary and the second
      leader of the Soviet Union (from 1922 until his death in 1953). During his
      premiership, he transformed the Soviet Union into a major world power
      (usually by implementing "5 Year Plans"). The industrialisation of the
      USSR and collectivisation of agriculture were his two main strategies -
      and, of course, police terror to help secure his position from any
      potential rivals or uprisings. Following Adolf Hitler's 'betrayal' in 1941
      when Operation Barbarossa was launched (Germany's invasion into the Soviet
      Union), Stalin and the USSR joined the Allies and heavily assisted in the
      defeat of Nazi Germany.

      Adolf Hitler was born in 1889, in Braunau am Inn, Austria. His father,
      Alois, died in 1903 - however he was never fond of him. Instead, Adolf was
      devoted to his mother, Klara. Throughout his early life and time in
      education, Adolf aspired to become a renowned artist. He was however,
      rejected on two occasions to study this field. The beginning of The Great
      War saw Hitler defend the Central Powers. He was awarded with the Iron
      Cross, First Class in 1918 - which was a rare achievement for a corporal.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Following The Great War, Hitler despised the Treaty of Versailles, which
      heavily limited the Weimar Republic in most ways. He joined the
      ational-sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (Nazi Party) in 1919
      (although it was not named this until the following year). He rose through
      the ranks until he eventually was made Chancellor of the Weimar Republic
      by Paul von Hindenburg (the state's then leader). He later assumed total
      control of the nation, turning it into Nazi Germany.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As the leader, or Der Führer, Hitler released terror and hatred into
      Europe - commiting numerable atrocities in his wake to secure domination.

    <br />
    <p>
      Michinomiya Hirohito was born in 1901 in Tokyo, Japan at the Aoyama
      Palace. He was the son of the Taishō emporer and the grandson of the Meiji
      emporer. He became Emporer of Japan in 1926 and served as Japan's
      longest-reigning monarch until his death in 1989.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Japan at the time was entering a stage of expansionism, invading
      neighbouring countries in order to secure resources that the Japanese
      mainland lacked in. Many believe Japan's actions in the late 1930s act as
      the beginning of the Second World War, and not Nazi Germany's invasion of
      Poland.

    <br />
    <p>
      Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was born in 1883 in Predappio, Italy.
      From an early age, Mussolini was disobedient, unruly, and aggressive. He
      was a bully at school, and as his teachers were unable to control him, he
      was sent to board with the strict Salesian order at Faenza. He proved to
      be more troublesome than ever during his time here.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      After initially falling in love with Marxism, Mussolini eventually became
      an avid 'antisocialist' and sought to create a new ideology in global
      politics - fascism. He was the first fascist leader (Il Duce) in Europe.
