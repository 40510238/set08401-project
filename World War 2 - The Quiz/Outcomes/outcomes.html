      The allied powers were the victors of the Second World War following the
      defeat of Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan in 1945. The Nazis were
      pushed back to Berlin where Hitler commited suicide with his wife, Eva
      Braun, from his secure bunker below the city. The Japanese Empire
      surrendered soon after the US attacked the cities of Hiroshima and
      Nagasaki with nuclear weapons (nicknamed "Fat Man" and "Little Boy").
      These bombs were dropped from the Enola Gay.

      The US remained in Japan following the war, aiding in its recovery and
      ensuring that a fair, democratic state spawned from the ashes of the
      former Empire. Europe, however, was carved up into East and West. With a
      famous "Iron Curtain" forming as the Soviets created puppet states in the
      territories they held at the end of the conflict. This, ultimately started
      a new conflict: The Cold War.
